# Animations

An **animation** is one lighting mode — a look the strip shows. You pick a
mode, and a few shared controls (brightness, speed, color, direction) tune how
it looks. Everything you choose is saved, so the strip comes back the same
after a power cut.

## Modes

| Mode | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| `off` | Fades the strip smoothly down to black, then stays off. |
| `white` | Solid white. |
| `static` | A solid color of your choosing (see [Color](#color)). Fades in from one end when you switch to it. |
| `rainbow` | A rainbow that scrolls along the strip. Its speed and direction are adjustable, and it works with [segmenting](#segmenting). |
| `runner` | A short trail of light that chases along the strip, brightest in the middle and fading at the ends. |

## Shared controls

These apply across modes and are set together with the mode (over
[MQTT](../channels/mqtt.md), or cycled with the [button](../channels/button.md)):

### Brightness

`brightness` runs from **1 to 100** — a simple percentage of full brightness.
`100` is as bright as the strip goes; lower values dim everything evenly.

### Speed

`speed` also runs from **1 to 100**, and controls how fast the animated modes
move. It only affects `rainbow` and `runner`; the solid modes ignore it.

| Mode | What speed feels like |
|---|---|
| `runner` | How fast the trail travels. `10` takes about 14 seconds to go once around a 144-LED strip; `100` sweeps it in under 2 seconds. |
| `rainbow` | How fast the rainbow scrolls. `10` is roughly one full color cycle per second; `100` is strobe-fast. |

Comfortable everyday values are around **5–20**.

### Color

`color` is a single `[red, green, blue]` value (each 0–255) used by the
color-driven modes — `static` fills the strip with it, and `runner`'s trail
takes it. `white` and `rainbow` ignore it.

### Direction

`direction` is either `"forward"` or `"backward"`. `"backward"` mirrors the
strip so animations play from the far end instead of the near end. It affects
every mode except `off`.

## Segmenting

Segmenting splits the strip into repeating blocks, so a pattern repeats every
few LEDs instead of stretching across the whole strip once. Configure it under
`leds.segmenting`:

```json
"segmenting": {"enabled": true, "length": 5}
```

- `enabled` turns it on; `length` is how many LEDs each repeat spans (minimum
  2).
- It only affects modes that repeat sensibly — mainly `rainbow`. Solid fills
  and the single running trail always use the whole strip.
- If `length` ends up as large as the strip, the whole strip is treated as one
  block (no repeat).
