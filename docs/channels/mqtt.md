# MQTT

MQTT lets anything on your network — Home Assistant, Node-RED, a phone app, or
a command line — control the device and watch its state. Where the
[button](button.md) gives you two gestures, MQTT gives you full control.

MQTT only works once [Wi-Fi](wifi.md) is connected and a broker is configured.

## What you can do

- **Control the lights** — turn them on or off, switch mode, adjust brightness,
  speed and color, resize the strip, turn on segmenting — by publishing a small
  message (see [Examples](#examples)).
- **See the current state** — the device publishes its full state whenever
  anything changes, so a fresh subscriber gets the latest immediately.
- **Know if it's online** — an online/offline status updates automatically,
  even if the device loses power unexpectedly.

For safety, settings that could knock the device off your network — Wi-Fi
credentials, the broker address, pin assignments — **can't** be changed over
MQTT, only the light controls above.

## Setting it up

Fill in the `mqtt` section of `config.json`:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `mqtt.enabled` | `true` | Master on/off switch for MQTT. |
| `mqtt.server` | `""` | Your broker's address (a hostname). Empty turns MQTT off. |
| `mqtt.port` | `1883` | Broker port. |
| `mqtt.user` / `mqtt.password` | `""` | Broker login, if it needs one. |
| `mqtt.base_topic` | `controller/led/1` | The prefix for every topic below — give each device its own. |
| `mqtt.use_single_topic_for_state_update` | `false` | Combine command and state onto one topic (see [Single-topic mode](#single-topic-mode)). |
| `mqtt.ssl` | `false` | Encrypt the connection (see [Secure connections](#secure-connections)). |
| `mqtt.certificate.validate` | `false` | Also verify the broker's identity (see [Secure connections](#secure-connections)). |
| `mqtt.certificate.name` | `""` | Filename of your CA certificate, stored in `certs/` on the device. |
| `mqtt.ntp_host` | `pool.ntp.org` | Time server, used only for secure connections. |

Changes take effect right away — the device reconnects with the new settings,
no reboot.

## Topics

Everything sits under your `base_topic` (default `controller/led/1`):

| You... | Topic | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Publish to | `<base_topic>/state/update` | Send a command. |
| Subscribe to | `<base_topic>/state/full` | The device's full current state, updated on every change. |
| Subscribe to | `<base_topic>/state/online` | `"online"` / `"offline"` availability. |

### What you can set

A command sent to `state/update` may only contain these:

| Group | Fields |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `current` (mode name), `brightness`, `speed`, `on`, `color`, `direction` |
| `leds` | `count`, `segmenting` |

Anything else is ignored. See [Animations](../animations/index.md) for what the
modes, `color`, `speed`, `direction` and `segmenting` actually do.

As a convenience you can set the color with a `mode.hexColor` string
(`"#ff781e"`, with or without the `#`) instead of the `color` array — MQTT
converts it to `color` for you. The published state reports both.

## Examples

These use `mosquitto_pub`/`mosquitto_sub`, but any MQTT client works the same
way. Replace `<broker>` and `<base_topic>` with yours.

Set brightness and switch to the rainbow mode:

```
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t <base_topic>/state/update \
  -m '{"mode": {"brightness": 80, "current": "rainbow"}}'
```

Resize the strip to 60 LEDs:

```
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t <base_topic>/state/update \
  -m '{"leds": {"count": 60}}'
```

Set the color (here as a `hexColor` string) and play the animation from the far
end of the strip:

```
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t <base_topic>/state/update \
  -m '{"mode": {"direction": "backward", "hexColor": "#ff781e"}}'
```

Turn on segmenting with a 5-LED repeat:

```
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t <base_topic>/state/update \
  -m '{"leds": {"segmenting": {"enabled": true, "length": 5}}}'
```

Watch the full state, which arrives on connect and after every change:

```
mosquitto_sub -h <broker> -t <base_topic>/state/full -v
```

```json
{"device": "e6614c311b331b35", "mode": {"current": "rainbow", "brightness": 80, "speed": 10, "on": true, "color": [255, 120, 30], "hexColor": "#ff781e", "direction": "forward"}, "leds": {"count": 144, "segmenting": {"enabled": true, "length": 5}}}
```

Each state message carries a `"device"` id; you don't need to send it.

## Single-topic mode

Some integrations prefer commands and state on a single topic. Set
`mqtt.use_single_topic_for_state_update: true` and both move onto
`<base_topic>/state` — you publish commands there and subscribe there for
state. The online/offline topic is unchanged.

## Secure connections

By default MQTT is unencrypted. Two settings tighten this:

- **`mqtt.ssl: true`** encrypts the connection (TLS).
- **`mqtt.certificate.validate: true`** additionally checks that the broker is
  who it claims to be, using a CA certificate stored at
  `certs/<mqtt.certificate.name>` on the device. This protects against someone
  impersonating your broker. Upload the certificate from the MQTT → Certificate
  section of `/config` (**Upload certificate**) — it's saved
  under its filename, which then appears in the **Certificate name** dropdown
  next to the other certificates already on the device; no manual file
  transfer needed.

When certificate checking is on but the certificate is missing or unreadable,
the device refuses to connect rather than falling back to an unverified
connection — it fails safe. A couple of practical notes:

- `mqtt.server` must be a **hostname**, not a bare IP address — certificates
  are issued for names, not IPs.
- Secure connections need the correct time, so the device syncs its clock from
  `mqtt.ntp_host` before connecting.

## Online / offline status

`<base_topic>/state/online` reports `"online"` while the device is connected
and `"offline"` when it isn't — including when it loses power or drops off
unexpectedly (the broker publishes that for it). Use it to drive an
availability indicator in your dashboard without polling.
